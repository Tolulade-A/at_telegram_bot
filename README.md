[![Medium Follow](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://medium.com/@tolulade-ademisoye)

In this project, I built a Telegram bot, the bot can get text messages, an image, a video, audio, and 
also a file/document. In addition, we will see how we can get the data [image, video, audio, 
and file] sharing to the bot at the server-side in a computer.


## Bot Features [Expected responses.]

- Text
- Image
- Video
- Document Type Response
- Audio Response
- Poll
- Quick reply Buttons
- Buttons with the links

## Installation Guide

Requires [python](https://www.python.org/) to run.

* Create Virtual Environment

```sh
virtualenv env --python=python3
```
Now activate virtual Environment
```sh
source env/bin/activate

Better still, you can use an IDE like PyCharm -easily create a virtual env
```
Install all the required libraries.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run python flask app.
```sh

You'll need ngrok/ a form of server to make your application live.
